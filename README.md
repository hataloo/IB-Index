# IB-Index
Scrapes www.ibindex.se for current weights and returns the number of stocks to buy in order to follow the index.

IB-index follow investment companies on the Stockholm Stock Exchange. IB-index gives the companies an equal base weight which is often preferable compared to a market weighted index. The weighting is adjusted according to the Net Asset Value discount or premium,
a discount gives a company an increased weight in the index whereas a premium gives a reduced weight. 

What is the rationale behind that? 

As an example, if investment company A has a market cap of 100 million SEK and own stocks of the publicly traded company B for a value of 120 million SEK you would pay a lower price for the stock of company B by buying stocks of company A. The theory is that investment companies traded at a discount will outperform investment companies valued at a premium.
